                <div class="content">
                    <p>I'm a newly minted Product Manager currently working for a UK based fintech focused on broadening access to higher education across the world by lowering the credit access barriers faced by international students.</p>
                    <p>My journey into product management has been typically atypical. I worked in retail for a short time, but spent the past couple years in my current company working in Operations
                        <br>
                        where I've interacted directly with customers as part of our Customer Success team, worked with our Product and Engineering teams to distell user needs into features and bring key new products to market.
                        <br>
                        My last role was as a Business Analyst, focusing on delivering continuous improvement initiatives to scale our internal operations to meet increasing customer demand.
                        <br>
                        Currently I lead a cross-functional team whose mission is to provide internal products and services that enhance the capabilities of our other product teams & business areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>What drew me to product management as a career was the prospect of leading cross-functional teams using technology to solve significant business problems while delivering value and delight users.
                        <br>
                        I'm a strong believer in using the agile philosophy to deliver valuable, high quality products to users quickly.

                        <li>As an opportunity to learn web development using a minimum viable product and iterative product development approach</li>
                    </ol>

                            <li>Written in plain HTML - so it was really quick to develop (took me less than 1 hour)</li>
                            <li>Focused on delivering the core value to the user - information about <em>me</em></li>
                            <li>Used to validate my learning - I have tracking in place to measure effectiveness (Google Analytics & bit.ly)</li>
